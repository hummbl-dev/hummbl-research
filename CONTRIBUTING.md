# Contributing to HUMMBL Research

This repository is a content and research portfolio for HUMMBL Systems.

- Use Markdown for models, validation studies, case studies, and essays.
- Use Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` for demonstrations only, not core development.
- Keep Python implementation code in the `hummbl-prototype` repository.
