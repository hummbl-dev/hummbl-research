## What This Is

HUMMBL (Base120) is a comprehensive framework of **120 mental models** organized across **6 transformations** that make engineering reasoning:

- **Explicit** (not implicit)
- **Traceable** (not black-box)
- **Improvable** (not fixed)
- **Executable** (not just descriptions)

**Not just ideas about thinking. Actual algorithms that run.**

### For Investors / Executives

**Business Impact:**
- **Reduces engineering decision time by 25-55 minutes** per complex problem (validated on project planning)
- **Improves problem-solving completeness by 20%** (95% vs 75% manual baseline)
- **Production-ready operator** (DE) scoring 9.2/10 utility with 98% test coverage
- **120 mental models** systematized into executable algorithms, enabling consistent reasoning across teams

**Market Position:** First framework to make mental models executable and traceable, bridging the gap between cognitive science and engineering practice.

### Understanding Operator Maturity

Operators are scored on a **5-dimension utility rubric (1-10 scale)**:
- **≥7.0/10 = VALIDATED** ✅ Production-ready, safe to use
- **<7.0/10 = BASELINE** ⚠️ Functional but experimental, use with caution

**What scores mean:**
- **9.2/10 (DE)**: Production-ready, exemplar quality
- **8.0/10 (RE, SY)**: Strong baseline, minor refinements needed
- **7.8/10 (P)**: Good baseline, close to validated
- **6.0/10 (CO)**: Functional but needs refinement
- **3.6/10 (IN)**: Experimental, significant work needed

Each operator is evaluated on: insight quality, usefulness, catch rate, speed, and recommendation likelihood.

## Quick Example

**Traditional approach:** "Just break it down and think through it..."

**HUMMBL Decomposition:**
```python
from hummbl import decompose

result = decompose("""
  Build distributed system with authentication,
  caching, monitoring, and horizontal scaling
""")

# Returns:
# • 8 components identified
# • 12 dependencies mapped
# • Critical path: 4 sequential steps
# • 3 parallel work streams
# • Coupling analysis
# • Traceable reasoning
```

HUMMBL transforms vague mental models into structured, executable algorithms that produce traceable outputs.

## Getting Started

**Quick start for engineers:** Get HUMMBL running in 5 minutes.

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hummbl-dev/hummbl-research.git
cd hummbl-research

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up API Key (Optional)

For Vertex AI features (enhanced SY19 recommender):
```bash
# Follow the setup guide
cat docs/create-api-key.md

# Or use the setup script
./setup-vertex-ai.sh
```

### 3. Run Your First Demo

**Recommended:** Start with the Decomposition (DE) operator demo:

```bash
# Run the workflow demonstration
python notebooks/hummbl_workflow_demo.py

# Or explore the notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/hummbl_workflow_demo.py
```

**What you'll see:**
- DE operator breaking down a problem into components
- Dependency mapping and critical path analysis
- Structured output with insights and confidence scores

### 4. Try SY19 Model Recommender

Get model recommendations for your problem:

```bash

## Transformation Operator Status

| Operator | Code | Status | Utility Score | When to Use | Implementation | Validation |
|----------|------|--------|---------------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| **Decomposition** | DE | ✅ VALIDATED | 9.2/10 | **Production-ready:** Use for any problem breakdown, architecture planning, or component identification. Safe for production use. | [hummbl-prototype](https://github.com/hummbl-dev/hummbl-prototype) | [`validation/decomposition-study-2025.md`](validation/decomposition-study-2025.md) |
| **Inversion** | IN | ⚠️ BASELINE | 3.6/10 | **Experimental:** Use for failure mode analysis, but expect limited extraction quality. Not recommended for production. | [hummbl-prototype](https://github.com/hummbl-dev/hummbl-prototype) | [`validation/inversion-study-2025.md`](validation/inversion-study-2025.md) |
| **Composition** | CO | ⚠️ BASELINE | 6.0/10 | **Functional:** Use for integration planning, but results may need manual refinement. Good for exploration, not final decisions. | [hummbl-prototype](https://github.com/hummbl-dev/hummbl-prototype) | [`validation/composition-study-2025.md`](validation/composition-study-2025.md) |
| **Perspective** | P | ⚠️ BASELINE | 7.8/10 | **Strong baseline:** Use for multi-stakeholder analysis and perspective shifts. Close to validated, minor refinements needed. | [hummbl-prototype](https://github.com/hummbl-dev/hummbl-prototype) | [`validation/perspective-study-2025.md`](validation/perspective-study-2025.md) |
| **Recursion** | RE | ⚠️ BASELINE | 8.0/10 | **Strong baseline:** Use for iterative refinement and feedback loop analysis. Very close to validated, safe for most use cases. | [hummbl-prototype](https://github.com/hummbl-dev/hummbl-prototype) | [`validation/recursion-study-2025.md`](validation/recursion-study-2025.md) |
| **Meta-Systems** | SY | ⚠️ BASELINE | 8.0/10 | **Strong baseline:** Use for system-level analysis and meta-patterns. Very close to validated, safe for most use cases. | [hummbl-prototype](https://github.com/hummbl-dev/hummbl-prototype) | [`validation/meta-systems-study-2025.md`](validation/meta-systems-study-2025.md) |

**Status Guide:**
- ✅ **VALIDATED**: Operators that have scored ≥7.0/10 and completed the full validation process. Production-ready, safe to use in production.
- ⚠️ **BASELINE**: Operators that are functional but either score <7.0/10 or have not yet completed the full validation process. Use with appropriate caution based on score.

### Validation Criteria

Operators must **both** score ≥7.0/10 on a 5-dimension utility rubric **and** complete the full validation process to achieve **VALIDATED** status:
1. Finds meaningful insights/components/failure modes  
2. Useful for analysis/debugging  
3. Catches things you'd miss mentally  
4. Faster than manual analysis  
5. Would recommend to others

### Phase 0 Strategy ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Baseline implementation of all 6 core operators by **November 25, 2025**. **ACHIEVED November 16, 2025**

**Approach:**
- Prioritize breadth (6 baseline operators) over depth (perfect implementation).  
- Use DE's 9.2/10 score as architectural template.  
- Mark operators below 7.0 threshold for post-Phase 0 refinement.  
- Enable case studies with a functional (if imperfect) operator portfolio.

**Results:**
- All 120 mental models fully developed and documented
- Framework status: FULLY DEVELOPED
- Ready for Phase 1 implementation and case studies

**Refinement Pipeline:**
- IN operator improvements documented in `validation/inversion-study-2025.md` Section 6.  
- Post-Phase 0 re-validation targets ≥7.0/10 scores for all operators.  
- User feedback will guide refinement priorities.

### Validation Methodology

Each operator undergoes:
1. Implementation following proven architectural patterns  
2. Comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration)  
3. Real-world test case validation  
4. 5-dimension utility scoring (1–10 scale)  
5. Gap analysis and refinement planning  
6. Production readiness assessment

Operators scoring ≥7.0/10 are marked **VALIDATED** for production use.  
Operators scoring <7.0/10 are marked **BASELINE** with documented refinement plans.
