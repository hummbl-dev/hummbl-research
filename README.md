## What This Is

HUMMBL (Base120) is a comprehensive framework of **120 mental models** organized across **6 transformations** that make engineering reasoning:

- **Explicit** (not implicit)
- **Traceable** (not black-box)
- **Improvable** (not fixed)
- **Executable** (not just descriptions)

**Not just ideas about thinking. Actual algorithms that run.**

---

## Quick Example

**Traditional approach:**
> "Just break it down and think through it..."

**HUMMBL Decomposition:**
```python
from hummbl import decompose

result = decompose("""
  Build distributed system with authentication,
  caching, monitoring, and horizontal scaling
""")

# Returns:
# • 8 components identified
# • 12 dependencies mapped
# • Critical path: 4 sequential steps
# • 3 parallel work streams
# • Coupling analysis
# • Traceable reasoning
