# Case Study X – <Short Problem Name>

## 1. Context

**System / Domain:**  
-  

**Architecture / Environment:**  
-  

**Constraints:**  
- Time:  
- Resources:  
- Risk tolerance:  

**Success Criteria:**  
-  

---

## 2. Problem Statement

- What is hard or unclear?  
- Why now?  
- What happens if we do nothing?  

---

## 3. HUMMBL Operator Sequence

**Sequence used (models):**  
`Pxx → INxx → DExx → COxx → RExx → SYxx → SY19 (reflection)`

For each step:

### 3.1 `<Operator Name>` (`Code`)

- **Question:**  
- **Inputs:** (text, diagrams, logs, code)  
- **Outputs:** (lists, artifacts, decisions)  
- **Notes:** (what changed in your understanding)

### 3.2 `<Next Operator>` (`Code`)

- …repeat per step…

---

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Before vs After

- **Before:**  
  - Architecture / plan / understanding:
- **After:**  
  - New architecture / plan / understanding:

### 4.2 Metrics (if available)

- Time saved vs naive approach:  
- Clarity improvement (self-rated):  
- Risk reduction (e.g., fewer unknowns / failure modes):  

---

## 5. Reflection

### 5.1 What Worked

-  

### 5.2 What Felt Heavy / Awkward

-  

### 5.3 Operator Insights

- Which operators were most useful?  
- Which felt redundant or underpowered?  
- Any surprising model recommendations from SY19?

## 6. Links & Artifacts

- Diagrams:  
- Code / notebooks:  
- Video recording (if any):  
- Related validation studies:
