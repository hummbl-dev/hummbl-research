# Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) Taxonomy Model

**Date:** 2025-11-18  
**Purpose:** Complement Biological Taxonomy with human interaction patterns  
**Relationship:** Maps human roles to AI agent archetypes  
**Hierarchy Levels:** 6 (mirrors Biological Taxonomy)

## Overview

The HITL Taxonomy Model defines how humans interact with, guide, and collaborate with AI agent archetypes. It complements the Biological Taxonomy by adding the human dimension to the agent ecosystem.

**Key Principle:** Different agent archetypes require different human interaction patterns.
