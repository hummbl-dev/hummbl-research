## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### 1. Case Study 1: Multi-Service AI System
**Priority:** High (Target: Jan 15, 2026)

**Actions:**
- [ ] Review SY19 recommendations (`validation/case-study1-sy19-recommendations.md`)
- [ ] Compare SY19 recommendations with planned sequence
- [ ] Finalize operator sequence (integrate IN02, DE01 if needed)
- [ ] Create architecture diagram
- [ ] Prepare test scenarios
- [ ] Schedule recording session

**SY19 Integration:**
- ✅ Recommendations generated
- ✅ Integration guide created (`case-studies/case-study1-sy19-integration.md`)
- ⏳ Ready to use during case study execution

### 2. Case Study 3: Ozzy Health Protocol
**Priority:** High (Target: Dec 15, 2025 - earliest deadline)

**Actions:**
- [ ] Schedule vet appointment
- [ ] Gather pre-vet data (current health status, concerns)
- [ ] Prepare HUMMBL operator sequence for health optimization
- [ ] Set up recording equipment
- [ ] Prepare documentation template

**SY19 Integration:**
- ✅ Tested with SY19
- ⏳ Generate specific recommendations for health protocol

### 3. Case Study 2: Fitness Transformation
**Priority:** Medium (Target: Dec 31, 2025)

**Actions:**
- [ ] Gather personal fitness data
- [ ] Define transformation goals
- [ ] Prepare operator sequence
- [ ] Schedule recording session

**SY19 Integration:**
- ✅ Tested with SY19
- ⏳ Generate specific recommendations for fitness transformation

## SY19 Usage Workflow

### Before Case Study:
1. Run SY19 on problem description
2. Review recommendations
3. Compare with planned sequence
4. Integrate useful recommendations
5. Update operator sequence if needed

### During Case Study:
1. Follow operator sequence
2. Use SY19 if stuck or need additional models
3. Document which SY19 recommendations were used
4. Note any models SY19 suggested that weren't used (and why)

### After Case Study:
1. Review SY19 recommendations vs. actual usage
2. Document learnings
3. Refine SY19 keyword detection if needed
4. Update case study with SY19 insights

## Case Study Execution Checklist

For each case study:

**Pre-Execution:**
- [ ] Problem clearly defined
- [ ] SY19 recommendations generated
- [ ] Operator sequence planned
- [ ] Materials prepared (diagrams, data, etc.)
- [ ] Recording equipment ready
- [ ] Documentation template ready

**During Execution:**
- [ ] Follow operator sequence
- [ ] Use SY19 when needed
- [ ] Document all outputs (diagrams, lists, decisions)
- [ ] Capture artifacts
- [ ] Note surprises and insights

**Post-Execution:**
- [ ] Extract written case study from recording
- [ ] Document SY19 usage
- [ ] Review quality (portfolio-worthy?)
- [ ] Publish and track engagement
- [ ] Extract operator insights
- [ ] Document framework refinements

---

## Success Metrics

**Case Study Quality:**
- Clear problem statement
- Complete operator sequence execution
- Concrete outputs (diagrams, plans, decisions)
- Measurable before/after impact
- Portfolio-worthy documentation

**SY19 Integration:**
- SY19 recommendations used effectively
- Operator sequence validated/improved by SY19
- Learnings documented for SY19 refinement

**Framework Validation:**
- Operators work in real-world scenarios
- Operator sequences are effective
- Framework provides value beyond synthetic tests

## Timeline

**December 2025:**
- Case Study 3: Ozzy Health Protocol (Dec 15)
- Case Study 2: Fitness Transformation (Dec 31)
- Case Study 1: Preparation (architecture, scenarios)

**January 2026:**
- Case Study 1: Multi-Service AI System (Jan 15)
- Phase 1 completion review
- Phase 2 planning

---

## Next Action

**Immediate:** Review Case Study 1 SY19 recommendations and finalize operator sequence.

**This Week:** Prepare Case Study 3 (Ozzy) - schedule vet appointment, gather data.

**This Month:** Execute Case Studies 2 & 3, prepare Case Study 1.
