# Phase 2 Scope Management Process

**Purpose:** Prevent timeline slippage through structured scope control and approval gates.

## Weekly Scope Review Process

### Schedule
- **Frequency:** Every Friday, 1-hour session
- **Format:** Solo review with documented outcomes
- **Duration:** 45 minutes review + 15 minutes documentation

### Review Agenda
1. **Progress Assessment:** What was completed this week?
2. **Scope Changes:** Any additions, removals, or modifications?
3. **Timeline Impact:** How do changes affect critical path?
4. **Risk Evaluation:** New risks introduced by changes?
5. **Approval Decision:** Proceed, modify, or reject changes?

### Scope Change Approval Gates

#### Gate 1: Minor Changes (<2 days impact)
- **Criteria:** Bug fixes, documentation updates, small enhancements
- **Approval:** Automatic approval with documentation
- **Process:** Log in weekly review, no formal gate

#### Gate 2: Moderate Changes (2-7 days impact)
- **Criteria:** Feature additions, integration changes, UX improvements
- **Approval:** Weekly review approval required
- **Process:** Propose change, assess impact, approve/reject/modify

#### Gate 3: Major Changes (>7 days impact)
- **Criteria:** Architecture changes, new features, scope expansions
- **Approval:** Formal review with impact analysis
- **Process:** Detailed proposal, stakeholder impact assessment, explicit approval

## Scope Control Metrics

### Weekly Tracking
- **Scope Creep Index:** (Actual hours / Planned hours) - 1
- **Target:** <10% creep per week
- **Current:** 0% (baseline)

### Monthly Reporting
- **Timeline Variance:** (Actual progress / Planned progress) - 1
- **Target:** >-5% (minimal slippage)
- **Current:** 0% (baseline)

## Scope Change Template

```
Scope Change Request

Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Requested By: [Name]
Change Type: [Minor/Moderate/Major]

Description:
[Brief description of proposed change]

Impact Assessment:
- Timeline Impact: [days/weeks]
- Resource Impact: [additional effort]
- Risk Impact: [new risks introduced]
- Dependency Impact: [affected components]

Justification:
[Why this change is necessary]

Alternatives Considered:
[Other approaches evaluated]

Recommendation:
[Approve/Modify/Reject with rationale]
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Change Prevention
- **Definition of Done:** Clear acceptance criteria for all work
- **Story Point Estimation:** Use consistent sizing for planning
- **Buffer Allocation:** Include 15% contingency in all estimates
- **Scope Boundaries:** Document what's explicitly out of scope

### Change Management
- **Early Detection:** Monitor velocity trends weekly
- **Impact Analysis:** Required for all changes >1 day
- **Rollback Plans:** Prepared for major changes
- **Communication:** All changes documented and shared

## Success Metrics

- **Timeline Adherence:** >90% of milestones met on time
- **Scope Stability:** <15% total scope creep
- **Process Efficiency:** <5% time spent on scope management
- **Risk Control:** No major surprises from scope changes

## Weekly Review Checklist

- [ ] Review completed work vs. planned
- [ ] Identify any scope changes
- [ ] Assess timeline impact
- [ ] Evaluate new risks
- [ ] Document decisions
- [ ] Update metrics
- [ ] Plan next week

## Emergency Procedures

If scope creep exceeds 20% in a week:
1. Immediate scope review meeting
2. Identify root causes
3. Implement corrective actions
4. Consider timeline adjustments
5. Update stakeholders

This process reduces Phase 1's 21% slippage to target <10% through proactive management.
