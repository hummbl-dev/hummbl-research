# Revision Guide: STEAM Paper Strengthening

**Date:** 2025-11-18  
**Purpose:** Guide for creating stronger version of STEAM paper based on critical audit

---

## Key Revision Principles

1. **Qualify All Universal Claims** - Change "universal principles" to "principles that appear in Base4"
2. **Acknowledge Theoretical Nature** - Distinguish theory from empiricism throughout
3. **Fix Circular Reasoning** - Don't claim sufficiency based on definition
4. **Clarify Analogies** - Acknowledge when analogies are metaphors, not identities
5. **Separate Science from Philosophy** - Distinguish empirical claims from interpretations
6. **Acknowledge Methodology Limitations** - Single author, not independent perspectives
7. **Add Counterexamples** - Consider systems that contradict claims
8. **Clarify Taxonomy Nature** - Theoretical/design-based, not natural/empirical

## Section-by-Section Revisions

### Abstract & Introduction
✅ **DONE** - Revised with qualifications and acknowledgments

### Methodology
✅ **DONE** - Expanded with taxonomy construction process and limitations

### Part I: Science
✅ **DONE** - Fully revised with:
- "Potential" hypotheses (not tested)
- Theoretical classification (not natural)
- Designed rules (not natural laws)
- Potential evolution (not observed)
- Proposed metrics (not validated)
- Metaphors acknowledged (not literal)

### Part II: Technology
**TO DO** - Key changes needed:
- Change "deploying 15.7M configurations" to "could deploy" or "theoretically deploying"
- Acknowledge that most are theoretical implementations
- Clarify that "platform" is potential, not actual
- Add counterexamples (complex systems that work)

### Part III: Engineering
**TO DO** - Key changes needed:
- Add counterexamples (complex systems that are successful)
- Clarify design choices vs. universal principles
- Acknowledge that "minimalism is good" is a design philosophy, not proven fact
- Add discussion of when minimalism might be a limitation

### Part IV: Art
**TO DO** - Key changes needed:
- Acknowledge subjectivity explicitly
- Change "Is X beautiful? (Yes...)" to "From a minimalist aesthetic perspective, X can be seen as..."
- Separate aesthetic claims from scientific claims
- Acknowledge that beauty is subjective

### Part V: Mathematics
**TO DO** - Key changes needed:
- Change "Theorem" to "Claim" or "Observation"
- Change "Proof" to "Informal Argument" or "Sketch"
- Acknowledge that "four concepts are sufficient" is not proven for all systems
- Clarify formal vs. informal mathematics

### Conclusion
**TO DO** - Key changes needed:
- Remove "universal principles" claim
- Change "reality itself is hierarchical..." to "Base4 suggests that computational reality might be..."
- Qualify all universal claims
- Acknowledge limitations throughout
