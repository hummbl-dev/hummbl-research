# CO01 - Composition Planning

> Assemble components into cohesive wholes with optimal interfaces.

## Description

Composition Planning focuses on how parts fit together to form greater systems. It evaluates coupling, cohesion, and interfaces to ensure components integrate efficiently, minimizing friction and maximizing emergent capabilities.

## Example

In software architecture, instead of building monolithic apps, compose microservices with clear APIs. This allows scalable, maintainable systems where each service can evolve independently while contributing to the whole.
