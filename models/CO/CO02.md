# CO02 - Modular Design

> Build systems from interchangeable, self-contained modules.

## Description

Modular Design emphasizes creating components that can be mixed, matched, and reused without tight dependencies. It promotes flexibility, scalability, and easier maintenance by isolating changes to specific modules.

## Example

In product design, use standardized parts (e.g., USB connectors) that work across devices. This allows rapid prototyping and customization without redesigning everything from scratch.

- CO01 – Composition Planning (guides module assembly)
- RE09 – Iterative Refinement (refines modules over time)

## Related Models

- TBD
