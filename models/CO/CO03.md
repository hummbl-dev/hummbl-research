# CO03 - Interface Design

> Define clean boundaries and contracts between components.

## Description

Interface Design focuses on the "handshake" between system parts—APIs, protocols, and standards that enable reliable interaction. It minimizes coupling while ensuring compatibility, making systems more robust and extensible.

## Example

In team collaboration, define clear roles and communication protocols (e.g., daily stand-ups) to prevent misunderstandings. This creates a "plug-and-play" team dynamic where members can swap without disrupting the whole.
