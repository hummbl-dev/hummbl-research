# CO04 - Emergent Properties

> Anticipate how component interactions create unexpected system behaviors.

## Description

Emergent Properties recognizes that the whole can exhibit traits not present in individual parts. Composition must account for these synergies or conflicts, designing for positive emergence while mitigating negative ones.

## Example

In social networks, individual connections create "network effects" like viral spread, which weren't predictable from single users. Designing with this in mind leads to features that amplify emergence, like recommendation algorithms.
