# CO05 - Constraint-Based Assembly

> Build systems by respecting and leveraging inherent constraints.

## Description

Constraint-Based Assembly uses limitations as design guides, composing solutions that work within boundaries rather than fighting them. This leads to elegant, efficient systems that turn constraints into strengths.

## Example

In resource-limited startups, constraints like small teams force lean composition (e.g., MVP focus). This creates nimble products that scale better than over-engineered alternatives.
