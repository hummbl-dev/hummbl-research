# CO06 - Layered Architecture

> Organize systems into hierarchical layers with clear boundaries.

## Description

Layered Architecture composes systems into abstraction layers (e.g., presentation, logic, data), ensuring each layer interacts only with adjacent ones. This promotes modularity and maintainability.

## Example

In web apps: UI layer (React), business logic layer (Node.js), data layer (database). Changes in one layer don't cascade unexpectedly.
