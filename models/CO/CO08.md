# CO08 - Integration Testing

> Test component interactions to ensure cohesive functionality.

## Description

Integration Testing composes validation by checking how components work together, not in isolation. It uncovers interface issues and emergent bugs missed by unit tests.

## Example

After building API and frontend separately, integration tests verify data flows correctly (e.g., form submission updates database).
