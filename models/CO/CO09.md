# CO09 - Coupling Minimization

> Reduce dependencies between components for flexibility.

## Description

Coupling Minimization composes systems with loose connections, using abstractions or contracts to allow independent evolution. It prevents ripple effects from changes.

## Example

Use dependency injection: Components receive interfaces, not concrete classes, so swapping implementations (e.g., databases) doesn't break others.

- CO02 – Modular Design (enables decoupling)
