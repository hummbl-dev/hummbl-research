# CO10 - Cohesion Maximization

> Ensure components have strong internal purpose and focus.

## Description

Cohesion Maximization composes components that are highly focused on a single responsibility, improving clarity and testability. It complements coupling minimization for optimal design.

## Example

A "user authentication" module handles only login/logout, not email sending. This makes it cohesive and reusable.
