# CO11 - API Design

> Define interfaces for seamless component integration.

## Description

API Design composes systems by creating standardized contracts (APIs) that allow components to interact predictably and scalably.

## Example

REST API for app: Define endpoints for user data. Frontend and backend compose via these interfaces without tight coupling.
