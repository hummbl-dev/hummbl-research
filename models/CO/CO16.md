# CO16 - Emergent Design

> Designing systems that evolve complex behaviors from simple rules.

## Description

Emergent Design is a mental model for creating systems where complex, adaptive behaviors arise from the interactions of simple components following basic rules. Instead of specifying every behavior explicitly, it focuses on designing the rules that will produce desired emergent properties.

## Example

Ant colony optimization algorithms:

- Simple rules: Follow pheromone trails, deposit pheromones
- Emergent behavior: Optimal path finding for complex routing problems

This approach is used in swarm intelligence, market dynamics, and self-organizing systems.
