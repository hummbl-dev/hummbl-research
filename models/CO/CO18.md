# CO18 - Interface Composition

> Building complex interfaces by composing simpler interface elements.

## Description

Interface Composition is a mental model for constructing user interfaces and APIs by combining reusable interface components. It emphasizes modularity, reusability, and the composition of simple interfaces into more complex ones, following principles like composition over inheritance.

## Example

React component composition:

- Basic components: Button, Input, Card
- Composed components: Form (composed of Inputs + Button), Dashboard (composed of Cards + Forms)
- Higher-order components: WithLoading, WithErrorBoundary

This approach enables flexible, maintainable interface design across different platforms and contexts.
