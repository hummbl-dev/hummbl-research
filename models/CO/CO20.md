# CO20 - Ecosystem Composition

> Building platforms that enable third-party innovation and network effects.

## Description

Ecosystem Composition is a mental model for designing platforms that grow through network effects and third-party participation. It focuses on creating the right incentives, APIs, and governance structures to encourage external developers and partners to build complementary products and services.

## Example

Mobile app ecosystems:

- Platform provides: Core APIs, developer tools, app store
- Third parties build: Apps, integrations, complementary services
- Network effects: More apps attract more users, more users attract more developers

This creates exponential value growth beyond what the platform could build alone.
