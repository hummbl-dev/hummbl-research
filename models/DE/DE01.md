# DE01 - Root Cause Analysis

> Drill down to the fundamental causes beneath surface symptoms.

## Description

Root Cause Analysis systematically decomposes problems to identify underlying factors, not just symptoms. Using techniques like the "5 Whys," it prevents recurring issues by addressing origins rather than patches.

## Example

A website crashes under load. Symptom: Crash. Why? Server overload. Why? Traffic spike. Why? Viral marketing. Root: Inadequate scaling. Solution: Auto-scaling infrastructure.
