# DE02 - Functional Decomposition

> Break systems into functional units based on purpose.

## Description

Functional Decomposition divides complex systems into smaller, purpose-driven functions. Each unit has a clear responsibility, enabling focused analysis, testing, and optimization without losing sight of the whole.

## Example

In app development, decompose "user authentication" into functions: validate credentials, generate tokens, handle errors. This allows independent development and easier debugging.
