# DE03 - Hierarchical Breakdown

> Organize components into levels of abstraction.

## Description

Hierarchical Breakdown structures systems in layers, from high-level goals to low-level details. This clarifies dependencies and priorities, making complex problems manageable by tackling one level at a time.

## Example

In project management, break "launch product" into: Strategy (market fit), Execution (development), Operations (support). Each level informs the others without overwhelming detail.
