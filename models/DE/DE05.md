# DE05 - Bottleneck Identification

> Find the limiting factors that constrain overall performance.

## Description

Bottleneck Identification decomposes systems to pinpoint the slowest or most constrained component. Optimizing bottlenecks yields disproportionate improvements, following the principle of least effort.

## Example

In manufacturing, if assembly takes 1 hour but painting takes 4, painting is the bottleneck. Streamlining painting (e.g., faster drying) speeds the whole line.
