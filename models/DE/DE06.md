# DE06 - Process Mapping

> Diagram workflows to identify steps, inputs, and outputs.

## Description

Process Mapping decomposes operations into visual flowcharts, revealing inefficiencies, redundancies, and dependencies. It uses tools like swimlane diagrams for clarity.

## Example

Mapping a customer order process: From "receive order" to "ship product," identify bottlenecks like manual approvals slowing delivery.
