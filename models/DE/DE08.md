# DE08 - Information Flow Analysis

> Trace how data moves through systems and identify bottlenecks.

## Description

Information Flow Analysis decomposes data pathways, mapping sources, transformations, and sinks. It highlights delays, losses, or inefficiencies in communication.

## Example

In a team project: Data flows from "requirements" to "design" to "code." Analysis shows email bottlenecks; switch to shared docs.

- DE04 – Dependency Mapping (overlaps with data dependencies)
- DE05 – Bottleneck Identification (focuses on flow issues)

## Related Models

- TBD
