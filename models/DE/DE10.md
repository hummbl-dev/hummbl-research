# DE10 - Subsystem Isolation

> Separate systems into independent subsystems for analysis.

## Description

Subsystem Isolation decomposes large systems by treating parts as black boxes, focusing on interfaces. It simplifies debugging and optimization.

## Example

In a car: Isolate "engine subsystem" from "electrical." Test engine performance independently before integrating.
