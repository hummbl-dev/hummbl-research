# DE11 - Value Stream Mapping

> Map the flow of value through processes to eliminate waste.

## Description

Value Stream Mapping decomposes workflows by visualizing value-adding vs. non-value-adding steps, targeting inefficiencies.

## Example

Manufacturing: Map raw materials to product. Identify "waiting" as waste, streamline to reduce lead time.
