# DE16 - Functional Decomposition

> Breaking down systems into their constituent functions and responsibilities.

## Description

Functional Decomposition is a mental model for analyzing complex systems by breaking them down into their core functions and sub-functions. It helps identify the essential capabilities a system must provide and how they can be organized hierarchically.

## Example

Breaking down an e-commerce platform:

- Level 1: Process orders
  - Level 2: Accept payment, Update inventory, Ship product
    - Level 3: Validate payment, Reserve stock, Generate label

This decomposition reveals functional dependencies and helps design modular, maintainable systems.
