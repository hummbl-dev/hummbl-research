# DE18 - Temporal Decomposition

> Breaking down processes and systems into distinct time-based phases or stages.

## Description

Temporal Decomposition is a mental model for analyzing dynamic systems by separating them into sequential phases, cycles, or time-based components. It helps understand how systems evolve over time and identify critical transition points.

## Example

Product development lifecycle:

- Phase 1: Ideation and planning (weeks 1-4)
- Phase 2: Development and testing (weeks 5-12)
- Phase 3: Launch and early adoption (weeks 13-16)
- Phase 4: Growth and optimization (weeks 17+)

Each phase has different success criteria, risks, and resource requirements.
