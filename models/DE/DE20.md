# DE20 - Failure Mode Decomposition

> Systematically identifying and analyzing all possible ways a system can fail.

## Description

Failure Mode Decomposition is a mental model for proactively identifying potential failure points in a system by breaking down components and analyzing how each could fail. It helps design more robust systems by anticipating and mitigating failure modes before they occur.

## Example

For a payment processing system:

- Network failure: Connection timeout, DNS resolution failure
- Service failure: Database unavailability, API rate limiting
- Data failure: Corruption, validation errors
- Security failure: Unauthorized access, data breaches

Each failure mode gets a risk priority number (RPN) based on severity, occurrence, and detection difficulty.
