# IN01 - Premortem Analysis

> Imagine the project has failed and work backwards to identify risks.

## Description

Premortem Analysis flips the perspective by assuming failure has occurred and then diagnosing the causes. This proactive inversion uncovers hidden assumptions, biases, and failure modes before they manifest, leading to stronger mitigation strategies.

## Example

Before launching a product, hold a "premortem" meeting: "Imagine it's 6 months later and the product flopped. Why?" Responses might reveal issues like "Market timing was wrong" or "Competitor undercut us," prompting preemptive adjustments.
