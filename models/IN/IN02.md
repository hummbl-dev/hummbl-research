# IN02 - Inversion

> Ask "How could this fail?" or "What would make this worse?" to find weaknesses.

## Description

Inversion involves flipping the problem to focus on preventing negatives rather than achieving positives. By considering obstacles, constraints, and failure paths, it reveals critical insights that positive thinking might miss, leading to more robust solutions.

## Example

When designing a security system, instead of "How do we make it impenetrable?", ask "How could an attacker break in?" This might highlight weak points like social engineering, prompting layered defenses.
