# IN03 - Murphy's Law Application

> Assume everything that can go wrong will go wrong, and plan accordingly.

## Description

Murphy's Law Application systematically anticipates worst-case scenarios by assuming failures will occur. It shifts from optimistic planning to defensive design, incorporating buffers, redundancies, and contingency plans to handle inevitable setbacks.

## Example

In software deployment, assume "What if the server crashes during peak load?" This leads to auto-scaling, backups, and rollback plans, turning potential disasters into manageable events.

- CO01 – Composition Planning (builds resilient systems)
