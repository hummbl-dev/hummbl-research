# IN04 - Regret Minimization

> Choose options that minimize future regret, not maximize immediate gain.

## Description

Regret Minimization inverts decision-making by focusing on avoiding future disappointment. It evaluates choices by imagining the worst outcomes and selecting paths that leave the least room for "I wish I had..." hindsight.

## Example

When investing, instead of chasing high returns, ask "Which choice will I regret least in 10 years?" This might favor diversified, low-risk options over speculative bets, reducing emotional fallout.
