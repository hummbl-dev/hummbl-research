# IN05 - Black Swan Preparation

> Prepare for rare, high-impact events that defy normal expectations.

## Description

Black Swan Preparation inverts normal risk assessment by focusing on outlier events—those that are unpredictable, rare, and devastating. It builds antifragile systems that benefit from volatility rather than succumbing to it.

## Example

In business continuity, beyond standard backups, prepare for "black swans" like pandemics or cyberattacks by diversifying suppliers and enabling remote work, turning crises into opportunities for innovation.
