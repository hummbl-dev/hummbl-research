# IN06 - Devil's Advocate

> Argue against your own ideas to test their strength.

## Description

Devil's Advocate involves deliberately taking the opposing viewpoint to challenge assumptions and uncover weaknesses. It prevents confirmation bias by forcing consideration of counterarguments.

## Example

Proposing a new feature? Play devil's advocate: "This will confuse users and increase support costs." If the counterarguments hold, refine the idea.
