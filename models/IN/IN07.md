# IN07 - Negative Visualization

> Imagine worst-case scenarios to prepare emotionally and practically.

## Description

Negative Visualization inverts optimism by vividly picturing failures, losses, or setbacks. It builds resilience and motivates proactive mitigation, drawing from Stoic philosophy.

## Example

Before a big presentation, visualize forgetting your lines and the audience reacting poorly. This reduces anxiety and prompts rehearsal.
