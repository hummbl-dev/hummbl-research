# IN08 - Failure Mode Effects Analysis

> Systematically identify potential failure modes and their impacts.

## Description

Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) inverts success by listing every way a system can fail, rating severity, occurrence, and detection. It prioritizes mitigations for high-risk failures.

## Example

In engineering, for a bridge design: Failure mode "corrosion" → Severity: High, Occurrence: Medium → Mitigate with coatings.

## Related Models

- IN03 – Murphy's Law Application (assumes failures happen)
- DE05 – Bottleneck Identification (focuses on failure points)

## Related Models

- TBD
