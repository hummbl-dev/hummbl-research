> Conduct failure simulations with team input to uncover blind spots.

## Description

Pre-Mortem for Teams inverts success by having the group imagine project failure and brainstorm causes, leveraging collective wisdom for mitigation.

## Example

Team meeting: "Project failed—why?" Responses reveal overlooked risks like "communication gaps." Implement fixes proactively.
