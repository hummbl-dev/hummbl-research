# IN16 - Inverse Design

> Designing solutions by working backwards from the desired outcome.

## Description

Inverse Design is a mental model that starts with the end goal and works backwards to determine the necessary steps and requirements. Instead of building forward from current constraints, it begins with the ideal outcome and identifies what must be true for that outcome to occur.

## Example

For a zero-downtime deployment:

- Desired outcome: Users experience no service interruption
- Work backwards: Requires blue-green deployment
- Which requires: Load balancer configuration
- Which requires: Identical environments
- Which requires: Infrastructure as code and automated testing

- CO04: Interface Design (designing from usage requirements)
