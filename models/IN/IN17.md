# IN17 - Assumption Inversion

> Challenging assumptions by systematically inverting them to find hidden truths.

## Description

Assumption Inversion involves taking core assumptions and deliberately inverting them to test their validity and uncover alternative perspectives. This mental model helps identify blind spots and prevents overconfidence in unexamined beliefs.

## Example

Assumption: "Users want more features"

Inverted assumption: "Users want fewer, better features"

This inversion might reveal that complexity is a barrier, leading to a minimal viable product approach instead of feature bloat.
