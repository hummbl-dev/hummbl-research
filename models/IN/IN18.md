# IN18 - Inverse Innovation

> Finding breakthrough solutions by inverting current industry practices.

## Description

Inverse Innovation is a mental model that looks for opportunities by doing the opposite of what everyone else is doing. By inverting conventional wisdom and industry norms, it can uncover underserved markets and novel approaches that competitors overlook.

## Example

Traditional SaaS: Monthly subscriptions with feature limits

Inverse innovation: Pay once, unlimited usage (like Sublime Text)

This inversion created a viable business model in a subscription-dominated market by appealing to users who prefer ownership over recurring costs.
