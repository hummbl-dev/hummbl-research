# IN19 - Failure Inversion

> Learning from successes by applying failure analysis techniques in reverse.

## Description

Failure Inversion takes the principles of failure analysis (like FMEA or premortem) and applies them to successful outcomes. By asking "What would have had to go wrong for this success to be a failure?", it helps identify fragile dependencies and hidden risks in positive scenarios.

## Example

After a successful product launch:

- What if the key engineer had left? (Single point of failure)
- What if the market timing had been off by 6 months?
- What if a competitor had copied the approach immediately?

This reveals success factors that need protection and diversification.
