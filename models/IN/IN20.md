# IN20 - Inverse Metrics

> Measuring what you want to avoid rather than what you want to achieve.

## Description

Inverse Metrics is a mental model that focuses measurement on negative outcomes to drive improvement. Instead of tracking desirable metrics (which can be gamed or misleading), it measures the absence of problems, creating more honest and actionable data.

## Example

Instead of measuring "customer satisfaction" (subjective and easily inflated):

- Measure "customer complaints per 1000 users"
- Measure "support ticket resolution time"
- Measure "churn rate within first 30 days"

These inverse metrics provide clearer signals for improvement and are harder to manipulate.
