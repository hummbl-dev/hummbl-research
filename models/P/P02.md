# P02 - Outside View

> Adopt an external, statistical perspective rather than an internal, anecdotal one.

## Description

The Outside View involves looking at a problem from a broader, statistical standpoint, using data from similar situations rather than focusing on unique details of the current case. This counters optimism bias and planning fallacy by emphasizing base rates and historical outcomes over personal intuition.

## Example

When estimating project timelines, instead of thinking "This project is special because of our expert team," use the Outside View: "Historically, 70% of similar projects overrun by 20%." This leads to more realistic planning and risk assessment.
