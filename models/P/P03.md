# P03 - Second-Order Thinking

> Consider not just immediate effects, but the effects of those effects.

## Description

Second-Order Thinking goes beyond first-order consequences to anticipate cascading impacts. It asks: "And then what?" repeatedly, revealing hidden feedback loops, unintended consequences, and long-term dynamics that first-order thinking misses.

## Example

In pricing strategy, a first-order thought is "Lower prices to attract customers." Second-order: "Lower prices increase volume, but might erode margins, leading to quality cuts, which could harm reputation and reduce long-term demand." This prevents shortsighted decisions.
