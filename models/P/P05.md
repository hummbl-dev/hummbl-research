# P05 - Opportunity Cost

> Evaluate choices by what you must give up, not just what you gain.

## Description

Opportunity Cost frames decisions by considering the value of the next best alternative foregone. It shifts perspective from absolute gains to relative trade-offs, highlighting hidden costs and encouraging prioritization.

## Example

When choosing between two projects, don't just compare their direct benefits. Ask: "What else could we do with those resources?" If Project A yields $100K but Project B (foregone) would yield $80K, the true cost of A is $80K in missed opportunity.
