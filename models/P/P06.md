# P06 - Mental Models

> Use frameworks and analogies to reframe problems.

## Description

Mental Models involves applying established frameworks, analogies, or heuristics to shift perspective on a problem. It draws from cognitive tools like checklists or metaphors to reveal hidden patterns and simplify complexity.

## Example

When debugging a software issue, use the "rubber duck debugging" analogy: Explain the problem to an inanimate object to gain clarity, reframing it as a communication exercise rather than pure logic.
