# P07 - Historical Analogy

> Draw lessons from past events to inform current decisions.

## Description

Historical Analogy reframes problems by comparing them to analogous historical situations. It helps anticipate outcomes by learning from precedents, but requires careful consideration of differences to avoid false parallels.

## Example

In product strategy, compare launching a new app to the rise of smartphones: Just as early adopters drove iPhone success, focus on user-centric features to build momentum.
