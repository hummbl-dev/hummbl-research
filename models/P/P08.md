# P08 - Future Backwards

> Start from the desired future outcome and work backwards.

## Description

Future Backwards reframes planning by envisioning success and reverse-engineering the steps needed. It counters present-bias by focusing on long-term goals, revealing obstacles and milestones.

## Example

For career planning, imagine "I'm a CTO in 10 years." Work backwards: What skills/experiences are needed? This might highlight the need for leadership training now.
