# P09 - Lateral Thinking

> Approach problems from unconventional angles.

## Description

Lateral Thinking encourages creative, non-linear problem-solving by challenging assumptions and exploring indirect paths. It uses techniques like random stimuli or provocation to break mental ruts.

## Example

Stuck on a design problem? Ask "What if the product was invisible?" This lateral shift might inspire minimalist features or new use cases.
