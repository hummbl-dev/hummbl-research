# P10 - Abstraction Ladders

> Move up and down levels of abstraction for broader/narrower views.

## Description

Abstraction Ladders reframes problems by climbing to higher-level concepts (e.g., "Why does this matter?") or descending to specifics (e.g., "What's the exact mechanism?"). It prevents getting stuck in one viewpoint.

## Example

Debugging code: Abstract up ("This is a data flow issue") to see patterns, then descend ("Check this variable assignment") for fixes.
