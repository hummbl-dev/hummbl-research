# P16 - Scenario Planning

> Anticipating multiple future possibilities to prepare for uncertainty.

## Description

Scenario Planning involves creating detailed narratives of different plausible future states to help organizations and individuals prepare for uncertainty. By developing 3-5 alternative scenarios, this mental model encourages thinking beyond single-point forecasts and helps identify robust strategies that work across multiple outcomes.

## Example

In software development, instead of assuming a single market trajectory, create scenarios for:

- Rapid adoption with viral growth
- Slow adoption requiring pivot strategies
- Competitive disruption requiring defensive positioning
- Regulatory changes affecting the product
