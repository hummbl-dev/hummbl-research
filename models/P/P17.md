# P17 - Stakeholder Mapping

> Identifying and analyzing all parties affected by decisions to understand interests and influence.

## Description

Stakeholder Mapping is a mental model for systematically identifying all individuals, groups, or organizations that have an interest in or are affected by a decision, project, or system. By categorizing stakeholders based on their power, interest, and influence, this model helps prioritize communication and engagement strategies.

## Example

For a new feature development:

- High power, high interest: Core product team, key customers
- High power, low interest: Executive sponsors, regulators
- Low power, high interest: End users, community contributors
- Low power, low interest: General public, indirect competitors

- SY02: Pattern Recognition (identifying stakeholder archetypes)
