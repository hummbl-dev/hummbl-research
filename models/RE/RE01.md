# RE01 - Feedback Loops

> Use iterative cycles of output feeding back into input for improvement.

## Description

Feedback Loops apply recursion by incorporating results back into the process. Positive loops amplify growth, negative ones stabilize, enabling adaptive systems that learn and evolve.

## Example

In product development, user feedback loops: Release MVP, gather data, iterate design. This creates compounding improvements over time.
