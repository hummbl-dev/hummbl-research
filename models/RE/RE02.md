# RE02 - Incremental Improvement

> Make small, repeated changes that compound over time.

## Description

Incremental Improvement uses recursion for gradual progress, avoiding overwhelm by focusing on marginal gains. It builds momentum through consistent, small steps rather than radical leaps.

## Example

In fitness, add 1 push-up daily. Recursively, this compounds to significant gains without burnout.
