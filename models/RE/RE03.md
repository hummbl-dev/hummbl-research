# RE03 - Prototyping Cycles

> Build, test, learn, repeat in rapid iterations.

## Description

Prototyping Cycles apply recursion through build-measure-learn loops. Each cycle refines based on real feedback, reducing risk and accelerating convergence on optimal solutions.

## Example

In design, sketch prototype, user-test, iterate. Recursion turns vague ideas into polished products efficiently.
