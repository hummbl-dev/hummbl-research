# RE05 - Evolutionary Algorithms

> Simulate natural selection through recursive variation and selection.

## Description

Evolutionary Algorithms apply recursion by generating variants, testing fitness, and iterating survivors. This mimics evolution for optimization problems, finding solutions that improve over generations.

## Example

In optimization, start with random designs, mutate, select best, repeat. Recursion evolves efficient algorithms or products.
