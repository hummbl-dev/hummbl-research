# RE06 - Iterative Design

> Refine designs through repeated cycles of creation and feedback.

## Description

Iterative Design applies recursion by building prototypes, gathering feedback, and improving. It embraces imperfection, converging on optimal solutions over time.

## Example

UI design: Sketch wireframe, user-test, iterate layout. Each cycle refines usability until satisfaction.
