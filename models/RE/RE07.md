# RE07 - Spiral Development

> Progress through expanding cycles of planning, risk analysis, and prototyping.

## Description

Spiral Development uses recursive spirals to manage risk, starting small and expanding scope with each loop. It integrates risk assessment into iterative growth.

## Example

Software project: Spiral 1 (requirements prototype), Spiral 2 (design prototype), each addressing risks like "scalability."

## Related Models

- RE04 – Adaptive Planning (adjusts spirals)
- IN08 – Failure Mode Effects Analysis (analyzes spiral risks)

## Related Models

- TBD
