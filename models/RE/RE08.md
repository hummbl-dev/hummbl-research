# RE08 - Agile Sprints

> Deliver working increments in short, focused time boxes.

## Description

Agile Sprints apply recursion through 1-4 week cycles of planning, execution, review, and retrospection. They enable rapid adaptation and continuous delivery.

## Example

Team sprint: Plan "add login feature," execute, demo, retrospect ("communication improved"). Next sprint builds on feedback.
