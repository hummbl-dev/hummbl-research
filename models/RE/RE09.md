# RE09 - Prototyping Loops

> Build quick models to test ideas and iterate based on results.

## Description

Prototyping Loops use recursive build-test-learn cycles to validate assumptions cheaply. They reduce risk by failing fast and refining early.

## Example

Product idea: 3D print prototype, user-test, iterate materials. Loops converge on viable design.
