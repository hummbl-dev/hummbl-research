# RE10 - Continuous Improvement

> Make ongoing, small enhancements through recursive reflection.

## Description

Continuous Improvement (Kaizen) applies recursion for perpetual progress, using PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycles to eliminate waste and optimize processes.

## Example

Manufacturing: Daily huddles identify inefficiencies, implement fixes, measure impact, repeat. Compounds into major gains.

## Related Models

- RE02 – Incremental Improvement (core to Kaizen)
- RE01 – Feedback Loops (enables checking/act)

## Related Models

- TBD
