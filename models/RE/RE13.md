# RE13 - Fractal Scaling

> Apply patterns recursively across scales.

## Description

Fractal Scaling uses recursion to replicate structures at different levels, creating self-similar systems that scale efficiently.

## Example

Network design: City blocks repeat neighborhood patterns, which repeat city layouts. Scales infinitely.
