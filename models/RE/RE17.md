# RE17 - Fractal Organization

> Organizing systems with self-similar structures at every scale.

## Description

Fractal Organization is a mental model for designing systems where patterns repeat at different scales, creating efficient, scalable structures. It applies the principle that optimal solutions at one level can inform solutions at other levels.

## Example

Holacracy organizational structure:

- Company level: Self-organizing circles
- Department level: Self-organizing sub-circles
- Team level: Self-organizing roles

Each level mirrors the same organizational principles, allowing infinite scalability and consistent behavior patterns.
