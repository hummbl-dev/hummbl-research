# RE18 - Meta-Learning

> Learning how to learn by analyzing and improving learning processes.

## Description

Meta-Learning is a mental model for developing more effective learning strategies by studying the learning process itself. It involves analyzing what makes learning successful and applying those insights to improve future learning experiences.

## Example

Improving study techniques:

- Level 1: Learn subject matter (e.g., programming concepts)
- Level 2: Learn study methods (spaced repetition, active recall)
- Level 3: Learn learning optimization (analyze which methods work best for different subjects)

This creates compounding learning efficiency over time.
