# RE19 - Bootstrapping Loops

> Creating self-reinforcing growth cycles where outputs become inputs for further growth.

## Description

Bootstrapping Loops is a mental model for building systems that grow exponentially by using their own outputs as inputs for future growth. It creates virtuous cycles where success begets more success through network effects and compounding returns.

## Example

Content platform growth:

- Initial content attracts users
- More users create more content
- More content attracts more users
- User-generated content reduces platform costs
- Lower costs enable more features
- More features attract more users

Each cycle amplifies the previous one, creating exponential growth.
