# RE20 - Self-Improving Systems

> Designing systems that automatically improve their own performance over time.

## Description

Self-Improving Systems is a mental model for creating autonomous systems that learn from their experiences and modify themselves to achieve better outcomes. It combines feedback loops, machine learning, and adaptive algorithms to create systems that evolve without human intervention.

## Example

Recommendation engines:

- Collect user interaction data
- Learn patterns and preferences
- Adjust algorithms to improve recommendations
- Better recommendations create more interactions
- More data enables further improvements

This creates a continuous improvement cycle that compounds over time.
