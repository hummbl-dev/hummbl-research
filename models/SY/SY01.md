# SY01 - System-of-Systems View

> Understand how systems interact at a meta-level.

## Description

System-of-Systems View synthesizes multiple systems into a higher-order whole, revealing interdependencies, conflicts, and synergies that individual analysis misses.

## Example

In urban planning, view transportation, housing, and economy as interconnected systems. Synthesis shows how traffic policies affect housing costs and vice versa.
