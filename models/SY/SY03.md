# SY03 - Holistic Integration

> Combine insights into a unified, coherent understanding.

## Description

Holistic Integration synthesizes fragmented knowledge into a complete picture. It bridges gaps, resolves contradictions, and creates narratives that explain the whole.

## Example

In diagnosis, integrate symptoms, tests, and history into a full health picture. Synthesis avoids partial views that miss root causes.
