# SY17 - Paradox Resolution

> Finding higher-order solutions that reconcile seemingly contradictory requirements.

## Description

Paradox Resolution is a mental model for addressing situations where traditional either/or thinking fails. It seeks "both/and" solutions that transcend apparent contradictions by finding higher-level frameworks that reconcile opposing forces.

## Example

Work-life balance paradox:

- Traditional view: Work vs. personal life (zero-sum)
- Paradox resolution: Integration through flexible work arrangements
- Higher synthesis: Work becomes personally fulfilling, personal life includes meaningful work

This approach transforms conflicts into opportunities for innovation.
