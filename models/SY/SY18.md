# SY18 - Holistic Integration

> Understanding and optimizing the whole system rather than isolated parts.

## Description

Holistic Integration is a mental model for seeing systems as integrated wholes where the performance of the entire system matters more than the performance of individual components. It emphasizes understanding interdependencies and optimizing for global rather than local maxima.

## Example

Sustainable agriculture:

- Conventional: Maximize individual crop yield
- Holistic: Integrate crops, livestock, and soil health
- Result: Higher total system productivity with lower inputs

This approach often reveals that optimizing components can harm the whole system.
