# SY19 - Meta-Synthesis

> Synthesizing multiple syntheses to create higher-order frameworks.

## Description

Meta-Synthesis is a mental model for integrating different synthetic approaches and frameworks into more comprehensive meta-frameworks. It operates at the level of synthesis itself, finding patterns in how different fields and disciplines create integrated knowledge.

## Example

Creating a universal problem-solving framework:

- Synthesis 1: Scientific method (hypothesis → experiment → conclusion)
- Synthesis 2: Design thinking (empathize → define → ideate → prototype → test)
- Synthesis 3: Systems thinking (analyze → synthesize → implement)
- Meta-synthesis: Integrated framework that combines all three approaches

This creates more powerful problem-solving capabilities.
