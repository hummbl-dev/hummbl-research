# SY19 - Meta-Model Selection

> Automatically recommends a sequence of HUMMBL models based on a problem description.

## Description

SY19 is a meta-model that recommends which HUMMBL models to use for a given problem. It uses the relationship graph (333 relationships across 120 models) to walk from primary models and suggest relevant models based on:

- **Relationship strength** (0.0-1.0)
- **Relationship type** (SCAFFOLDS, COMPOSES_WITH, REFINES, etc.)
- **Model centrality** (how connected a model is)
- **Graph distance** (models closer to primaries score higher)

The scoring formula:
```
score = strength × type_weight × direction_weight × centrality_weight × hop_decay
```

Type weights:
- SCAFFOLDS: 1.0
- COMPOSES_WITH: 0.9
- REFINES: 0.8
- PARALLELS: 0.5
- CONTRASTS_WITH: 0.4
- CONFLICTS: 0.3

## Example

**Problem:** "multi-service AI feature with bottlenecks and cascades"

**Primaries:** DE07 (Bottleneck Identification), DE06 (Failure Mode Analysis)

**Recommended Models (Top 7):**
1. DE07 – Bottleneck Identification 🔹 Primary
2. DE06 – Failure Mode Analysis 🔹 Primary
3. SY01 – System Topology (via DE07)
4. CO03 – Pipeline / Flow Composition (via DE07)
5. RE06 – Feedback Loops (via SY01)
6. SY04 – Cascades & Second-Order Effects (via cascade keyword)
7. CO12 – Queues / Buffering (via pipeline)

This yields a structured reasoning arc: identify bottlenecks → map system topology → analyze pipelines → check for cascades → design queues.

## Implementation

**Tool:** `tools/sy19_recommend.py`

**Usage:**
```bash
# With explicit primaries
python tools/sy19_recommend.py "problem description" --primaries DE07 DE06

# Auto-detect primaries from keywords
python tools/sy19_recommend.py "multi-service system with bottlenecks"

# Save to file
python tools/sy19_recommend.py "problem" --output recommendations.md
```

**Features:**
- Automatic primary model detection from keywords
- Graph traversal with configurable depth (max_hops)
- Centrality-weighted scoring
- Primary model boost (ensures primaries stay in top-K)
- Detailed reasoning (why each model was recommended)

## Related Models

- **SY01** – System Topology (often recommended from structural analysis)
- **SY04** – Cascades & Second-Order Effects (recommended for cascade scenarios)
- **DE07** – Bottleneck Identification (common primary for performance problems)
- **DE06** – Failure Mode Analysis (common primary for reliability problems)
