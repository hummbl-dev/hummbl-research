# CO17 - Orchestration Patterns

> Coordinating multiple services and processes into coherent workflows.

## Description

Orchestration Patterns is a mental model for designing and managing complex workflows that coordinate multiple independent services or processes. It focuses on the control flow, error handling, and state management needed to compose reliable distributed systems.

## Example

E-commerce order fulfillment:

- Payment orchestration: Coordinate payment processor, fraud detection, inventory check
- Fulfillment orchestration: Warehouse selection, shipping calculation, notification dispatch
- Saga pattern: Ensure all steps succeed or all are compensated

This model helps manage the complexity of distributed transactions and service interactions.
