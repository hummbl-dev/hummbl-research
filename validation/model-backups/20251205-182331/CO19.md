# CO19 - Service Mesh Design

> Managing communication between microservices through a dedicated infrastructure layer.

## Description

Service Mesh Design is a mental model for managing the complex networking, security, and observability requirements of microservice architectures. It introduces a dedicated infrastructure layer that handles service-to-service communication, allowing application code to focus on business logic.

## Example

In a microservice architecture:

- Service mesh handles: Load balancing, circuit breaking, mTLS encryption
- Application services focus on: Business logic, data processing
- Benefits: Improved reliability, security, and observability without code changes

Tools like Istio and Linkerd implement this pattern by providing sidecar proxies for each service.
