# DE14 - Morphological Analysis

> Systematically explore combinations of component variations.

## Description

Morphological Analysis decomposes problems into dimensions, then combines variations to generate solutions.

## Example

Transportation: Dimensions like "vehicle type," "energy source." Combine to find "electric bikes" or "flying cars."

## Related Models

- DE07 – Cause-Effect Diagrams (explores variations)
- CO04 – Emergent Properties (from combinations)

## Related Models

- TBD
