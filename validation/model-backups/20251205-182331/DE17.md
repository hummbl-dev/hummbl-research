# DE17 - Data Flow Decomposition

> Analyzing systems by tracing how data moves and transforms through processes.

## Description

Data Flow Decomposition is a mental model for understanding systems by mapping how information flows from input to output, identifying transformation points, storage locations, and decision branches. It reveals the data dependencies and processing pipelines within a system.

## Example

User registration data flow:

- Input: User form data
- Transform: Validate format, hash password
- Store: User database
- Transform: Generate confirmation email
- Output: Welcome email sent

This decomposition helps identify bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, and optimization opportunities in data processing pipelines.
