# DE19 - Responsibility Decomposition

> Separating system components based on their distinct areas of responsibility.

## Description

Responsibility Decomposition is a mental model for designing systems by clearly defining and separating the responsibilities of different components. It follows the single responsibility principle and helps create maintainable, testable systems with clear boundaries.

## Example

In a web application:

- Controller: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- Service: Implement business logic
- Repository: Manage data persistence
- Model: Represent domain entities

Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility, making the system easier to understand and modify.
