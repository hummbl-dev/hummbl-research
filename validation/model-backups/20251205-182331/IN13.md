# IN13 - Cost-Benefit Inversion

> Evaluate decisions by focusing on costs first, then benefits.

## Description

Cost-Benefit Inversion inverts analysis by prioritizing downsides, ensuring conservative estimates and avoiding over-optimism.

## Example

Investment: Start with "What's the worst-case loss?" before considering gains. This prevents sunk-cost fallacies.
