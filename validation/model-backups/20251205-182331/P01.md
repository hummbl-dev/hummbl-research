# P01 - First Principles

> Strip away assumptions and focus on core, unchanging truths.

## Description

First Principles thinking involves breaking down complex problems into their most basic, fundamental elements and building up from there. Instead of relying on analogies or existing solutions, question every assumption to uncover the true essence of the problem. This mental model is particularly useful for innovation and avoiding incremental thinking.

## Example

When designing a new transportation system, instead of copying existing models (e.g., cars or trains), ask: What is the fundamental need? (Moving people efficiently.) What are the core constraints? (Physics, energy, safety.) This might lead to radical ideas like hyperloops or autonomous pods, unconstrained by historical precedents.
