# P04 - Systems Thinking

> View problems as interconnected systems rather than isolated parts.

## Description

Systems Thinking emphasizes relationships, feedback loops, and emergent behaviors within a whole system. It shifts focus from individual components to how they interact, revealing leverage points and unintended consequences that linear thinking overlooks.

## Example

In supply chain management, instead of optimizing one factory, consider the entire ecosystem: Supplier delays affect production, which impacts customer satisfaction, creating feedback loops. This might reveal that investing in supplier relationships yields better overall results than local efficiencies.
