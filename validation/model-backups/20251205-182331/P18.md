# P18 - Systems Thinking

> Viewing problems as interconnected systems rather than isolated components.

## Description

Systems Thinking is a mental model that emphasizes understanding the relationships, feedback loops, and emergent behaviors within complex systems. Instead of focusing on individual parts, it encourages seeing the whole picture and how changes in one area can cascade through the entire system.

## Example

When optimizing database performance, systems thinking reveals that:

- Query optimization affects server load
- Server load impacts user experience
- User experience influences business metrics
- Business metrics drive resource allocation decisions
