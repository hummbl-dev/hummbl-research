# P19 - Opportunity Cost Analysis

> Evaluating decisions by considering the value of forgone alternatives.

## Description

Opportunity Cost Analysis is a mental model that focuses on the true cost of any decision by calculating what must be given up to pursue a particular course of action. It helps avoid the sunk cost fallacy and ensures resources are allocated to their highest-value use.

## Example

When deciding between two projects:

- Project A: Expected ROI 15%, requires 6 months development
- Project B: Expected ROI 12%, requires 3 months development

The opportunity cost of choosing A includes not only the direct costs but also the 3 months where B's returns could have been earned.

- CO03: Resource Allocation (optimizing across constraints)
