# P20 - Long-term vs Short-term Thinking

> Balancing immediate gains with sustainable future benefits.

## Description

Long-term vs Short-term Thinking is a mental model that helps evaluate decisions by considering both immediate consequences and future implications. It prevents short-term optimizations that create long-term problems and ensures sustainable growth over time.

## Example

In technical debt management:

- Short-term: Ship feature quickly with quick hacks
- Long-term: Invest in clean architecture and automated testing

The model helps quantify when short-term sacrifices are worth long-term gains, and vice versa.
