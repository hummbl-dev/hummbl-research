# RE15 - Evolutionary Computation

> Use recursive variation and selection to evolve solutions.

## Description

Evolutionary Computation simulates natural selection through recursive generations of variation, selection, and inheritance.

## Example

Algorithm design: Generate code variants, test fitness, select best, mutate. Recursively evolves optimal solutions.
