# RE16 - Recursive Optimization

> Improving systems through iterative, self-referential optimization cycles.

## Description

Recursive Optimization is a mental model for continuous improvement where optimization processes themselves become subjects of optimization. It creates feedback loops where the act of improving efficiency also improves the improvement process.

## Example

A/B testing optimization:

- Level 1: Test different landing pages
- Level 2: Optimize the testing process itself (better statistical methods)
- Level 3: Optimize the optimization framework (machine learning for test design)

Each level improves both the outcome and the process of achieving it.
