# SY16 - Cross-Domain Synthesis

> Integrating insights and patterns from different disciplines to create novel solutions.

## Description

Cross-Domain Synthesis is a mental model for discovering breakthrough innovations by connecting concepts from unrelated fields. It encourages looking beyond disciplinary boundaries to find unexpected connections and analogies that lead to creative solutions.

## Example

Biomimicry in engineering:

- Biology: Lotus leaf repels water
- Materials science: Self-cleaning surfaces
- Engineering: Hydrophobic coatings for solar panels
- Business: "Sticky" subscription models

This synthesis creates innovations that no single discipline could achieve alone.
