# IN10 - Antifragility Assessment

> Evaluate if systems benefit from shocks rather than just withstand them.

## Description

Antifragility Assessment inverts resilience by checking if volatility improves the system (antifragile) vs. just surviving it (robust). It seeks opportunities in uncertainty.

## Example

A startup: Economic downturns force innovation (antifragile) vs. just cutting costs (robust). Assess by asking "Does chaos make us stronger?"
