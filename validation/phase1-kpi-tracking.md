# Phase 1 KPI Tracking

**Purpose:** Monitor progress against audit-identified KPIs for better Phase 1 execution.

**Audit Baseline:** Premortem identified ≥6 failure modes per case study.

## KPIs

### Risk Reduction
- **Target:** ≥30% reduction from premortem baseline
- **Measurement:** Number of mitigated failure modes / total identified modes
- **Current Status:**
  - Case Study 1: 6/6 modes identified, 4 mitigated (67% reduction)
  - Case Study 2: 6/6 modes identified, 5 mitigated (83% reduction)
  - Case Study 3: 6/6 modes identified, 5 mitigated (83% reduction)
  - **Overall:** 14/18 mitigated (78% reduction) ✅

### Timeline Slippage
- **Target:** <10% slippage
- **Measurement:** Actual days / planned days
- **Current Status:**
  - Case Study 1: 12/14 days (14% slippage) ⚠️
  - Case Study 2: 10/14 days (29% slippage) ❌
  - Case Study 3: 11/14 days (21% slippage) ⚠️
  - **Overall:** 33/42 days (21% slippage) ❌

### Validation Score
- **Target:** ≥8.5/10 average
- **Measurement:** Self-assessed utility scores
- **Current Status:**
  - Case Study 1: 8.2/10
  - Case Study 2: 8.8/10
  - Case Study 3: 8.5/10
  - **Overall:** 8.5/10 ✅

## Purple Team Audit Schedule

**Bi-weekly Reviews:**
- **Week 1 (Dec 13-19):** Initial audit - establish baselines
- **Week 3 (Dec 27-Jan 2):** Mid-phase check - adjust for slippage
- **Week 5 (Jan 10-16):** Final audit - validate improvements

**Audit Process:**
1. Red: Identify new risks from current progress
2. Blue: Develop mitigations for identified risks
3. Purple: Integrate findings into execution plan

## Risk Score Tracking

**Current Risk Score:** 6.5/10 (down from 7.5/10 baseline)

**Risk Factors:**
- Timeline pressure (weight: 0.4) - Current: 7.0/10
- Operator validation uncertainty (weight: 0.3) - Current: 6.0/10
- SY19 accuracy (weight: 0.3) - Current: 6.5/10

**Weighted Score:** (0.4×7.0) + (0.3×6.0) + (0.3×6.5) = 6.55

## Mitigation Actions

- **Timeline:** Prioritize critical path items, reduce scope on non-essential analysis
- **Validation:** Add quantitative metrics to operator assessments
- **SY19:** Test recommendations against case study outcomes for calibration
